# siteTest
The Corroboration of Concepts For Reality.

# UPDATE THE SITE WORKS FOR ALL DEVICES

I'll be publishing all kinds of test results on the site for my journey into programming. 

As far as testing is concerned, this site only works for regular devices for example PCs, mobile phones however will not load. "Not found" is the front page when site rendering is complete.
