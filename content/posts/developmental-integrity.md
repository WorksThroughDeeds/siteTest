Currently, the projects for the site are on a hault. Since doing this, I have gained a tremendous amount of dicipline in figuring out this static site generator. There was pain, patience, and continous encouragement for the success of this site. Reasons for not continuing in advacements into this plan was due to the lack of experience with other themes and what entailed with them like CMS(Content Management System) or using StartBootstrap(themes to use for site content presentation). Another includes I'd say maybe poor documentation. Some of the documentation wasn't understandable, and I struggled for atleast a week trying to figure it out. In fact, I was getting closer and closer to why I couldn't solve my problem. One of them was because I was not injecting a module for the folder the files were in.

And another issue was not being able to create the content needed for the theme. The theme is what you will see as a description for site detail/style. Before hand I was struggling getting the site to serve locally. That came to a success after some extreme measures of continous research on what was going wrong. 

I am sure I can figure it out, but there is a roadblock. And I can't seem to get passed it right now. So there is going to be a total revamp of the site features and content. Stay tuned for what is to come.
